# Maxthon Extensions / .mxaddon

Some Maxthon extensions I made and managed to save before the Extension Center for MX3/MX5 was disabled. All of them are packaged in .mxaddon already. If you want to look inside, you need [MxPacker](https://forum.maxthon.com/index.php?/topic/15294-sdk-maxthon-extension-development-guide-package-tool-20150521/) for Windows: run MxPacker and unpack .mxaddon using the GUI or just drag .mxaddon onto the MxPacker.exe icon to unpack it.
